# faustao-jones
Simple Javascript game for study purposes

## The game
The game it's kind of a Hangman Game, you have to guess the letters to form the word, if you miss it, it counts an error.
This goes until you lose all of your chances, then the Indiana Jones fall on the lava and you lose, or until you guess the entire word.
